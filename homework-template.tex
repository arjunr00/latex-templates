\begin{exercise}{1} % Does not have to be a number
    Here is an exercise.

    \begin{theorem}{Label}
        Here is a theorem.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        Here is a proof.
        See the little box at the end?
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}{Label}
        Here is a lemma too.
    \end{lemma}

    The \texttt{reflection}, \texttt{proposition}, and \texttt{corollary} environments work the same way.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{2}
    Here is another exercise.
    Some nifty math shortcut commands are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Set of natural numbers: $\N$
        \item Set of integers: $\Z$
        \item Probability: $\prob(A)$
    \end{itemize}

    See \texttt{homework.sty} if you want to add more similar shortcuts.

    Say you want to highlight some text. These commands make it \red{very easy} \blue{to do so}.
    If you want to highlight text in a math environment:
    \begin{align*}
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad \mred{(see? } \mblue{easy.)}
    \end{align*}

    See \texttt{homework.sty} if you want to add more colors.
